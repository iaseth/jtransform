# jtransform
[`jtransform`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jtransform) is a small `JavaScript/TypeScript` library containing some of the most commonly used transforms, written in `TypeScript`.

I felt the need for `jtransform` when I was working on [`josn`](https://github.com/iaseth/josn).

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
